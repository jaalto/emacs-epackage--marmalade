@import "blueprint";

//Recommended Blueprint configuration with scoping and semantic layout:
body {
  @include blueprint-ie(true);
  // Note: Blueprint centers text to fix IE6 container centering.
  // This means all your texts will be centered under all version of IE by default.
  // If your container does not have the .container class, don't forget to restore
  // the correct behavior to your main container (but not the body tag!)
  // Example:
  // .my-container
  //   text-align: left
}
